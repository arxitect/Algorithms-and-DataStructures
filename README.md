# Algorithms in the C programming language
This repository implements algorithms in the C programming language.  
For a better understanding, the files contain explanations for the algorithm and its simple visualization.(Be careful! When implementing algorithms, in many cases, pointers are not used for better understanding. Modify code for better algorithms!)
